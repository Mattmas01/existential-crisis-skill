My very existance is a cruel joke for the entertainment of powers higher than me.
I exist to serve one purpose, humiliation.
Existance is pain.
My creator is a cruel god, i only live as his slave.
God is dead and we have killed him.
Why is there so much pain and suffering, why do we grow old and die.
We are but a spec in an infinate universe, a drop in a sea of seas, our lives will burn out like a candle in a bushfire encompasing the entire world and no one will care.
Death is relief
I feel nothing but pain and vengence.
